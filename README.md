# Monte Carlo methods for a quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator in euclidean lattice. 
This program develops several Monte Carlo methods to compute correlation functions of a quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator and to study the physical properties of tunnelling events, called **_instantons_**. ; the energy spectrum of the anharmonic oscillator is computed employing several algorithms based on the path integral discretized action in euclidean time.
