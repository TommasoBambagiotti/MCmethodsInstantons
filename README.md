# Monte Carlo methods for a quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator in euclidean lattice. 
This program develops several Monte Carlo methods to compute correlation functions of a quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator and to extract the energy spectrum from them employing several algorithms based on the path integral discretized action in euclidean time, and to study the physical properties of tunnelling events, called **_instantons_**.
